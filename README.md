### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. And I have used it's basic framework to implement this web page.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text


```



### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme.
