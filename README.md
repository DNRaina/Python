### Python - a brief intoduction
Python is an interpreted language. Python IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) supports multiple instances at the same time. Python IDLE provides us with two working modes- interactive and shell mode.

While the interactive mode is a very great option for the teachers to provide their pupils with an interactive way of learning a language which was considered difficult not many years ago.

The best part about Python programming is the fact that Python doesnâ€™t has a very steep learning curve and is extremely useful for machine learning as well as artificial intelligence.

an example of a python code

# print line (sys.stdout.write("string goes here")


string_1 = "hello viewer"
